### CPSC 120

* Lab 3

    Lab 3, part 1 was one of my favorites as it's basically my first time coding formally in the C++ language. I was able to figure out the best pizzaria for the best deal. This lab made me realized how vast the digital world is and how coding can be applied to almost everything.


* Lab 7

    Lab 7, part 1 was one of my favorites as it was very intriguing and in      teresting to make. During this lab we are also introduced into command line vectors, and using while statements along with if statements to figure out if a integer value is either too low, too high or correct.


* Lab 8

    Lab 8, part 1 was one of my favorites as it introduced 2D vectors by using for loops to make some type of visual output through the use of asterisks, dashes, and bars. This particular lab is super interesting as this could be applied into making videogames.
